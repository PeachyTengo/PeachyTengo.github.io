        <h2> Labs</h2>
        <h3> Lab 0</h3>
          <p>In this lab, I installed Apache Web Server, Git, Sublime Text Editor and Pandoc. After those were installed, I started off by adding my name to my Apache2 default page in HTML through the Sublime Text Editor. From there, I cloned the class repository onto my VM. Next, I created an SSH key to be able to work through my repository. From there I was able to clone my repository onto my VM. Next, I copied a folder from the class repository into my own and edited it to fit me. Finally I added,commited, and pushed the newly edited README.md file onto my Github.</p>
        <h3> Lab 1</h3>
          <p>In this lab, I used wireshark to capture the HTTP request and responses. In part 2, I also used the programming language C to develop two different CGI files that I executed in the console and were able to see them in the browser. In task 2 I learned about a simple PHP web application with user input. Lastly in task 3, I learned about understanding HTTP GET and POST requests and also about the curl program.</p>
        <h3> Lab 2</h3>
          <p>In this lab, I learned how to create a HTML file. I started with a very basic template and added multiple different aspects to it using different tools. I started by adding the time and clock to the HTML by using JavaScript. I also added a JavaScript file and pull the data to the HTML. I then added asynchronous data retrival while using Ajax. Next, I used CSS to make my HTML look more presentable by adding color and different shapes to the HTML. This helped by making it not look so dull. After that, I added the jQuery library and used JSON to make the Ajax requests much shorter and adding easier code than before. Lastly, I used APIs to create a joke to upload automatically and to tell someone what age they are based on their name.</p>

        <h2> Hackathon</h2>
        <h3> Hackathon 1</h3>
          <p>In this lab, we went over 7 different cross-site scripting attacks on different levels. The attackes were performed on Level 0. The attacks are based on levels. I start at level 0, being the easiest, and work my way up to level 6, being the hardest. In each attack, the goal was to produce an alert message with my name on it to show that the payload worked successfully. After I learned how to take advantage of the vulnerabilities in this lab, I learned how to defend them. I went back to my previous labs and revised them to have input validation and cross-site scripting defense methods.</p>
