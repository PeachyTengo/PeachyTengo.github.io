          <h2><strong>Experience</strong></h2>
          <h3> United States Marine Corps </h3>
          <p> In my time in the military, I started off by going to different Electronics schools to gain knowledge for my career field. I graduated from two schools giving me the title of 
              Ground Electronics Maintainer and Telecommunication Equipment Technician. I then completed a follow-on school to receive the title of Microminiature Repair Technician. 
              Over the time I spent in Camp Lejeune, I worked my way up to becoming Section Head of the Microminiature Repair Section. In this duty, I oversaw daily operation to ensure the 
              section was working as proficiently as possible. While in this role, I also mentored 10+ Marines on technical and leadership capabilities.
